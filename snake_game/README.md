# Snake Game

A simple Snake game implemented as a learning project.

## Description

This project contains a basic implementation of the classic Snake game. The player controls a snake that grows longer as it eats food; the game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.

## Requirements

- A modern version of Python (3.7+) or the language/runtime used by this repository.
- Any required libraries listed in the project (check project files for specifics).

## Build & Run

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone <repository-url>

2. Change into the project directory:
   cd snake_game

3. Install dependencies (if any). For Python projects:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the game:
   python main.py

Adjust commands for the project's actual entry point or language (for example, use `npm start`, `dotnet run`, etc., if appropriate).

## Controls

- Arrow keys or WASD to move the snake.
- Esc or close window to exit.
